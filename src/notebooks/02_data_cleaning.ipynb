the fitting room and i saw two of this dress on a rack- an xs and small. i could tell by looking at it that it runs small, so i grabbed a small to try on. i didn't want to love this dress (it's expensive), but i did. it is so pretty and flattering. i wish it were an inch or two longer, but it's ok. with tights in the fall will be fine. not sure i would wear this to work, as i am a teacher

i was skeptical to order but very glad i did as it is better in person. it is beautiful, high quality tommy bahama inspired suit. i am 55 so short shorts are risky even though i am a typical size 4 or 6. i took a 4 in the blazer and i am typically a high 4 or low 6 in size so i would say the blazer is very true to size. i took the size 8 in the shorts as i felt they ran small and i wanted the extra length. they ride a bit lower on my waist an\",\n{\n            'v': 5,\n            'f': \"5\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 1,\n            'f': \"1\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 1,\n

oddly on me. i'm usually a petite s so i purchased the xs in brown. first. the color was more gray-brown but it was still ok. but second, the fit was off. maybe i just got a bad one, but the center of the blouse was so offset, that the slit in the front laid so far to the left and the v-neck was so low that you could see my bra - there was no adjusting i could do to fix it. the material has a lovely soft silky feel to it an\",\n{\n            'v': 1,\n            'f': \"1\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 0,\n            'f': \"0\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 7,\n            'f':
